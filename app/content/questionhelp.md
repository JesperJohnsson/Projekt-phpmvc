#Welcome to GameQuest!
We’d love to help you, but the reality is that not every question gets answered. To improve your chances, here are some tips:
__Be specific,__
if you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful, relevant answer.

__Make it relevant to others,__
we like to help as many people at a time as we can. Make it clear how your question is relevant to more people than just you, and more of us will be interested in your question and willing to look into it.

__Keep an open mind,__
the answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn’t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn’t always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don’t agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember: we’re just trying to help.

__Title__ :
This should be the question you have summed up in a small conclusive sentence. Try to be as captivating as possible :)

__Tags__ :
The tags are which categories your question fits in as. For example if you're going to write something about a game called "A", then a good tag for that question would be "A" the game title, "B" the main genre the game has, "C" a more specific explanation of your problem.
So to clarify here comes a real life example, say I got a problem for being banned in GTA V for using mods, good tags will be as follows:
<blockquote>GTA V, Mods, Banned</blockquote>

Remember to split your tags into separate tags use the comma between each word/sentence, as displayed above.

__Description__
This is the main part of your question, all the detailed information and other thoughts of yours. All that is left now is for you to start asking questions and being a part of this awesome community.
Here it's perfectly fine to use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [bbcode](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode), [shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) to format your text!
