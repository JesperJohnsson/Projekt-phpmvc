#About GameQuest
GameQuest was made as a final assignment for the [phpmvc](http://dbwebb.se/phpmvc/) course. GameQuest is a Anax-Mvc based Question forum, where you as an user can ask and answer questions about game related content.

##Introduction
GameQuest are for you who need to find out something about a game or simply help out others in need. For you dire to find a community of other gamers to discuss with. My intention was to make GameQuest just such a place. With the reputation and activity system built into we hope to reward those who both give good questions and answers. In turn giving their questions a greater chance of catching more attention with the reward of a bounty. When you've accumulated atleast 50 reputation you can spend those on such a bounty.

##About me
My name is Jesper Johnsson and i'm a 19 year old living in Karlskrona studying in [BTH](http://www.bth.se/) and this is my final assignment for the [phpmvc](http://dbwebb.se/phpmvc/) course. This is the final course of my first year in [BTH](http://www.bth.se/) and so far it's been a fun time. I'm doing this fulltime so the days are full with programming and other computer related things.
